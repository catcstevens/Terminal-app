# Description

The terminal application that I will be developing will be the long awaited Infinite Improbability Drive that powers the spaceship Heart of Gold in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

Modern society has created a decision overload. Everyday a person needs to decide what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, what transport they should use to commute before they even get to work! Implicit is the ramifications of these decision. If I eat bacon will my vegan colleague smell it on me? Is it problematic that my shoes might have been made in a sweat-shop? Is there any point in buying an electric car when the electricity is generated from coal-power?

This application, written in Ruby and run on the command line will help busy professionals make decisions quickly without worried that they will have unintended consequences.
