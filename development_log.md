Day 2 of my terminal application assignment and I have already had my plans derailed. A family emergency meant I had to leave Coder Academy early on the 09/11. As a result I started today with very little done, so I had to spend extra time working on my assignment today to get back on track.

Before leaving yesterday Bianca gave me the go ahead to start working on the control flow diagram and and a project management plan for my terminal project. I also set up the folder for my app with all of the files that I think I will need, which came from information I received reading over the project scope a few times and making notes. I initialised a git repository and pushed it to GitHub.

I have a good idea of what my terminal app will do, so I decided to start on the control flow diagram - glitch number 2! I have built such a simple diagram that I am certain it is missing elements. I decided to focus instead on my project management plan, which really fleshed out the idea, although I think it will change as I go. I have succesfully avoided jumping into hours of investigating the potential sprinkles I will use if I get time and instead stuck to my Trello plan.

Today has been quite successful. The control flow diagram and project management plan have proved so helpful to start coding my terminal application. Even though they took a bit of time to do, they have saved me so much time in coding. I followed the control flow diagram to psuedocode my app and then filled in the code in two hours. As I coded I checked off everything I have been doing in Trello. It not only gave me a sense of how much I have achieved, but I could immediately see the areas where my app has not met the specifications. I didn't realise that I haven't included a method that I have written, and while I have two booleans, I don't have an actual loop written in. I have decided to add the method in for adding images, which I will work on tomorrow, but I will have to change one of the Booleans to a loop. I am thinking that where I have used Faker to puts random quotes from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I might instead save a selection of appropriate quotes in an array and loop through them. I also need to work out where to add my error handling, and my biggest issue for the next few days will be adding images. I particularly want to add a gif - but it is proving to be both difficult AND problematic. I am also worried that it is too basic, so I will run that by Bianca tomorrow.

A frustrating, challenging, but productive day at school today. My most difficult issue has been that my colorize is broken so that it colorizes, but then repeats the string in white. I am going to ignore the problem for the moment to focus on more important things. I have managed to add a loop, and found a way to randomly pull a quote from an array. I have also added a very simple method, but I will add a more complex method tomorrow. I have also figured out the best place to put my error handling.
