| User can input name to customise user experience           | App asks user for name. App gets.chomp to allow user to input name into terminal. App saves input into a variable called name so that it can use variable throughtout the running of the app. | When the ruby file was run it prompted user to input their name. When the user inputted their name it was saved in a variable and in the next line their name was used to say hello, and later in the app to ask the user a question. |
| Use colorize to make the terminal app look more attractive | Calling the colorize gem at the end of a string should make the string change to the variable colour in the terminal. | When the ruby file was run the colorize gem did not work as it should have. It changed the colour of the string, but then printed the string a second time in the original colour. As it was a cosmetic bug I removed it. |
