# Software Development Plan

The terminal application that I will be developing will be the long awaited Infinite Improbability Drive that powers the spaceship Heart of Gold in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

The user will approach the Infite Improbability Drive (IID) with a burning conundrum. The IID will use its advanced processing speed to work out the improbability of the event having negative repurcussions. It will then inform the user what there chances are, and as a byproduct the energy created in solving this problem will provide the energy to power the heart of darkness. If the problem gives a result of infinite improbability it will create an image to indicate flying in hyper-drive.

### The Problem

Modern society has created a decision overload. Everyday a person needs to decide what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, what transport they should use to commute before they even get to work! Implicit is the ramifications of these decision. If I eat bacon will my vegan colleague smell it on me? Is it problematic that my shoes might have been made in a sweat-shop? Is there any point in buying an electric car when the electricity is generated from coal-power?

### The Audience

This application is aimed at anxious professional people who are stuck in the paradox of choice. 

### How it will be used

The user will input the decision they are afraid to make due to fear of their choice having unwanted side effects. The application will use its advanced processing power to output the odds of their decision going wrong. If the odds are low enough the app will recommend going ahead with the decision. If the improbability is high enough the Improbability Drive will go into Hyperdrive and simulate flying through space.

# Features

1. Method

There will be a lot of text and images in this application, so there will be a method to clear the screen at each condition so that the user output can be more easily identified. 

There will also be animated asciiart in more than one place, so a method will define how to loop through the various images.

These will both use local variables.

1. Control Structure/ loops

After getsing the users name this application enters an until loop. The user can input true/ false / quit. If the user inputs true it will enter an if/else, output a message or image and return to the beginning of the loop. If the user enters false the appliaction will output a quote, then return to the beginning of the loop. Inputting quit will exit from the loop.

*make sure to use the terms "use of variables and variable scope"*

1. Error Handling
* begin, rescue, end. *Where will it be used?*

# User Interaction and Development
*Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user*
